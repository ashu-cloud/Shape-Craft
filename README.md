# Shape-Craft
This Python program provides an engaging and interactive way for users to generate and visualize different geometric shapes, such as rectangles, squares, circles, and more. 
By entering specific details such as the dimensions (e.g., width, height, or radius), coordinates (which determine the position of the shape on a 2D plane), and the color of the shape, users can create custom shapes tailored to their preferences.

The program starts by prompting the user to choose the type of shape they want to generate. Then, depending on the selected shape, the user is asked to input the appropriate dimensions. 
For example, when selecting a rectangle, the user must specify both the width and height; for a circle, the user only needs to provide the radius. 
Additionally, users can define the coordinates that determine where on the plane the shape will appear, making this program a tool for exploring spatial relationships. 
Lastly, the user can pick a color to customize the visual appearance of their shape.

Once all the details are provided, the program generates the shape and displays it according to the user’s specifications. 
This project not only demonstrates the power of user input and geometric calculations but also serves as a hands-on way to explore graphical programming concepts. 
It’s ideal for anyone looking to learn more about shapes, coordinates, colors, and basic Python programming, while having fun creating their own custom designs.
